# Islandora Scholar [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_scholar.png?branch=7.x)](https://travis-ci.org/Islandora/islandora_scholar)

## Introduction

Islandora Scholar is a suite of modules designed to help Islandora function as an Institutional Repository. It provides a framework for handling Citation and Thesis objects, and a variety of additional features for working with citations. It includes:
* Citation Content Model and Thesis Content Model (and associated default forms)
* Display formatted citations based on MODS data based on user-uploaded CSL files
* (optional) tab on Citation objects containing the self-archiving policies of the associated periodical, based on Sherpa/RoMEO
* (optional) links on Citation and Thesis objects to search for them in Google Scholar or your local discovery layer
* Importers and populators to create objects based on DOIs, PMIDs, Endnote XML, or RIS files (see associated submodules)
* Ability to embargo objects or datastreams permanently or with a time limit (see Scholar Embargo submodule)
* Google Scholar-ready microdata in meta tags
