This is one of two complementary tests, addressing an odd case reported by user Alexius.

http://forums.zotero.org/discussion/9141?page=1#Item_5

The relevant portion of the post is below:


I need to place 2 sections related to authors within bibliography:
1st - before title (exists only when number of authors < 4). Here only first author's name should be placed.
2nd - after title. Here all authors' names (formatted not like in 1st section). If number of authors >= 4 then here after first-author should be [et al]

Example:
Stamou, A.I. Evaluation of thermal comfort in Galatsi Arena of the Olympics “Athens 2004” using a CFD model / A.I. Stamou, I. Katsiris, A. Schaelin // Applied Thermal Engineering. – 2008. – Vol. 28, № 10. – P. 1206–1215.

Stamou, A.I. Title of the Article / A.I. Stamou, I. Katsiris, A. Schaelin
