In general, the most robust predictors of negative events are gender, alcohol use frequency, age of onset, and increasing drinking due to happy hours/bar specials. While it was linked to various negative and illegal behaviors, altered happy hour drinking was not associated with an increased likelihood of an alcohol-related arrest.</abstract><abstract displayLabel="CONCLUSIONS">This study lends support to the idea that alcohol price specials should be regulated in an effort to reduce high consumption and alcohol-related negative consequences. Future research into the relationship between happy hour drinking and negative outcomes is necessary and should examine the impact of happy hour advertisements, different types of specials, and the timing of happy hours.</abstract><name type="personal"><namePart type="family">Baldwin</namePart><namePart type="given">Julie Marie</namePart><role><roleTerm authority="marcrelator" type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart type="family">Stogner</namePart><namePart type="given">John M</namePart><role><roleTerm authority="marcrelator" type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart type="family">Miller</namePart><namePart type="given">Bryan Lee</namePart><role><roleTerm authority="marcrelator" type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><originInfo><dateCaptured encoding="iso8601">2014-04-23</dateCaptured><dateIssued encoding="iso8601">2014-04-23</dateIssued><dateOther type="season"/></originInfo><identifier type="issn">1747-597X</identifier><part><detail type="issue"><number>1</number></detail><detail type="volume"><number>9</number></detail><extent unit="page"><list>17</list></extent></part><language><languageTerm>ENG</languageTerm></language><identifier type="doi">10.1186/1747-597X-9-17</identifier><identifier type="pmc">PMC4017966</identifier><identifier type="accession">24758616</identifier><relatedItem type="host"><titleInfo><title>Substance abuse treatment, prevention, and policy</title></titleInfo><titleInfo type="abbreviated"><title>Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy</title></titleInfo></relatedItem><genre>journal article</genre><note type="type of work">journal article</note><recordInfo><recordOrigin>PubMed</recordOrigin></recordInfo><note type="date issued">2014 Apr 23 </note><note type="date captured">2014 4 23 </note><note type="record creation date"/><note type="status">imported</note></mods>
